# Discord-Spam-Script
This script is intended to be used with Pokécord to increase your Pokémon's levels, whilst bypassing Discord's rate limiting.  

# Using this script to attack a server won't work, because it sends too slowly, so don't bother

# What does it do?
This script will send 9 messages every 8 milliseconds, then wait 5 seconds and start again.  

# How do I make it say something else?
Change `:smiley:` to something else.  Open an issue, or PM me on Discord/Telegram if you know me on there and would like some help.
